- [**Deep Sketch Hashing: Fast Free-hand Sketch-Based Image Retrieval**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05605.pdf)
- by Li Liu, Fumin Shen, Yuming Shen, Xianglong Liu and Ling Shao

to be presented on [CVPR 2017](http://cvpr2017.thecvf.com/) spotlight section. This work focuses on fast sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) using binary codes.

## Prerequisites
To produce the binary codes described in the paper, one needs to install [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) beforehand.
The mid-level Sketch-Token representation is required for training the model. The codes can be found [here](https://github.com/gitlim/SketchTokens). Please refer to the following papers for more details.

## Models
We provide several pretrained models on two datasets with their respective deploy files. You may try to use any of these models to produce hash code for image-sketch matching.
